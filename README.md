# Balls!

A simple 2D ball physics engine I coded from scratch. I finished this several years ago, but decided to polish it up a bit in a dedicated repository.

## Setup

Just to see the demo, no setup necessary! Just check it out here: rasaichimori.github.io/balls/
Otherwise, I just use svelte and vite for the website, and p5js to visualize the simulation
